# ternary_plot_app
This repository contains an interactive Shiny web application for creating ternary plots. Ternary plots are a powerful visualization tool commonly used in various fields of science, including chemistry, geology, and engineering, to represent compositional data with three variables constrained to sum to a constant. This app allows users to input their data and generate customizable ternary plots dynamically. Key features include:

- Input data directly or upload CSV files
- Customize plot appearance
- Review data in table format
